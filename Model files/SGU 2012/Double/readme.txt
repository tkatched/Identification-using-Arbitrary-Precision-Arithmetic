List of files in the Model files\SGU 2012\ Double folder:

Matlab functions:


sgusolv.m - solves the baseline specification of the linearized model using gensys_mod2.m, with the original observables (log-differences)

sgusolvl.m - solves the baseline specification of the linearized model using gensys_mod2.m, with the observables in levels

sgusolvl3.m - solves the baseline and an MA shocks specification of the linearized model using gensys_mod2.m, with the observables in levels

sgusolvl4.m - solves the baseline and a particular single MA shock specification (the rest remain news shocks) of the linearized model using gensys_mod2.m, with the observables in levels
