constraintlp.m - constraint function that enforces (non-) invertibility of MA shocks in optimization; also can be used for within regime global identification (excludes a sup-norm neighborhood around theta0).

kllp.m - computes the KL distance between two models.

kloptlp.m - the objective function for global optimization search.

pfhlp.m - computes empirical distance between two models.

vfhlp.m - computes asymptotic variance of the LR test used in the empirical distance computation in pfhlp.m.
