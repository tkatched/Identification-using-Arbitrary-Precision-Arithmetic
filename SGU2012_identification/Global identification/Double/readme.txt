constraintsgu.m - constraint function used for within regime global identification: excludes a neighborhood around theta0.

klsgul.m - computes the KL distance between two models (baseline specification, observables in levels).


klopsgul.m - the objective function for global optimization search.

klopsgulinv2.m - the objective function for global optimization across model structures: all news vs. all MA shocks.

klopsgulinv3.m - the objective function for global optimization across model structures: all news vs. one MA shock, the rest news.
