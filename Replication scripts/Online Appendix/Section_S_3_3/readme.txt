Matlab scripts:


sgu_local_levels_bc.m - script that conducts local identification checks using observables in levels at the BC frequencies only in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision

sgu_local_levels_par_bc.m - same as sgu_local_levels_bc.m  above, but with the parallelized computation of the G-matrix used.

sgu_local_original_obs_bc.m - script that conducts local identification checks using the original observables (in log-differences) at the BC frequencies only in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision

sgu_local_original_obs_par_bc.m - same as sgu_local_original_obs_bc.m  above, but with the parallelized computation of the G-matrix used
