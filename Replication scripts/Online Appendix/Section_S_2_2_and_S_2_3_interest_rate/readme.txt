Matlab scripts:

S2_2_and_S2_3_results_ir.m - a master script for replicating all the local identification results for the small scale manetary-fiscal model while adding interest rate as observable.

local_analysis_ir.m - script that conducts local identification checks for all considered cases in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision, while adding interest rate as observable

local_analysis_indeterminacy_ir.m  - local identification checks in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision for 1000 simulated points from the indeterminacy region, while adding interest rate as observable


Simulate_ind.m - simulates points from the indeterminacy region used in local_analysis_indeterminacy_ir.m.



Subfolders:
