List of files in the folder \Replication scripts\Online Appendix\Section_S_2_4

Section_S_2_4.m - replicates the nonidentification curves reported in Section S.2.4 as well as global identification analysis allowing the  er_t shock to have a noninvertible MA representation.


Subfolders:

Nonidentification curves - contains scripts that replicate the nonidentification curves

Noninvertibility - contains scripts that perform global identification analysis with non-invertibility of er_t in double and arbitrary precision.

The overall code structure in the above subfolders is essentially the same as in the main paper replication Section_5_3_and_5_4 folder.
