Subfolders:
Sec5_3_auxiliary_scripts - contains the scripts to check global identification across regimes in double and arbitrary precision

Sec5_3_Nonidentification_curves - contains the scripts to extend nonidentification curves for each case considered in the paper, as well as additional verification of equivalence along the curves in quadruple precision.
