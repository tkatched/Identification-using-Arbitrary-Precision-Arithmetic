Matlab scripts:

Section_6_2_results.m - a master script for replicating results in the Section 6.2 of the paper in the order of discussion

sgu_local_levels.m - script that conducts local identification checks using observables in levels in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision

sgu_local_levels_par.m - same as sgu_local_levels.m  above, but with the parallelized computation of the G-matrix used

sgu_local_original_obs.m - script that conducts local identification checks using the original observables (in log-differences) in double, quadruple and 50-digit precision

sgu_local_original_obs_par.m - same as sgu_local_original_obs.m  above, but with the parallelized computation of the G-matrix used
